abstract: >
  The increasing demand for proactive patient outreach and
  follow-up within health insurance providers and large
  hospital systems has led to the adoption of automated
  message classification systems. Although state-of-the-art
  tools like Azure and OpenAI o1 series are available, their
  costs are prohibitive for small companies. Therefore,
  using cost-effective traditional tools for text
  classification is still a valuable alternative.

  This study investigates how OpenAI's ChatGPT can generate
  synthetic data to balance class distributions in medical
  message datasets and improve the performance of binary
  classification models. The primary aim is to classify
  messages that indicate medical needs, aiding in patient
  outreach and efficient resource allocation. We applied
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including
  Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost,
  and BERTimbau, a Portuguese transformer-based model.
  Models were trained on both original and augmented
  datasets, and results showed a significant increase in
  classification accuracy, particularly with BERTimbau,
  whose performance improved from 84\% to 99\%. Synthetic
  data also reduced overfitting by narrowing the gap between
  training and validation accuracies while improving model
  robustness on unseen data. Our findings demonstrate that
  synthetic data from ChatGPT effectively addresses class
  imbalance, improving the robustness and accuracy of
  medical message classification models. However, challenges
  remain in correctly classifying non-medical messages,
  indicating that further refinement in synthetic data
  generation is necessary for optimal performance in
  real-world scenarios. These results suggest that such
  approaches can significantly enhance automated patient
  engagement efforts.
